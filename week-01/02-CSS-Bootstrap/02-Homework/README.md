- A responsive layout
- The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.

### Hints

- Use Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns).

- On an `xs` screen, content should take up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device vs. your computer to see examples of these differences.

### Bonus

- Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site (**Hint:** Check out the Bootstrap documentation).
