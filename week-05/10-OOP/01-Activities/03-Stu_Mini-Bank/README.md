# MiniBank

In this activity you will use objects to create a mini banking application.

## Instructions

Update the `createMiniBank` function to achieve the following:


6. Return the `printBalance`, `printStatement`, `deposit`, `withdraw` functions from the `createMiniBank` function.

* Then, create a new `minibank` object using the `createMiniBank` function.

1. Print the `minibank` balance.

2. Deposit some money into the `minibank` object.

3. Print the `minibank` balance.

4. Withdraw some money from the `minibank` object.

5. Print the `minibank` balance.

## Bonus üèÜ

* Add code to throw an error if the user tries to withdraw more money than they have, or try to deposit or withdraw values that aren't positive numbers.

* Add code to return a copy of the `statement` when `getStatement` is called, rather than returning the original array.
