## Instructions

### Part 2

* While those are installing, work with your group to answer each of the following questions using the [ReactJS Documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/):

1. In the previous section we installed Create React App. What is it for?
    * Create React App is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React. It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production. You’ll need to have Node >= 8.10 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine. Create React App doesn’t handle backend logic or databases; it just creates a frontend build pipeline, so you can use it with any backend you want. Under the hood, it uses Babel and webpack, but you don’t need to know anything about them.
