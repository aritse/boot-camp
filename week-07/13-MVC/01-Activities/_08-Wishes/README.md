- **Instructions**

  - Create an app with Express, MySQL and Handlebars.

    - HINT: this app will be very similar to the app your instructor just demonstrated and slacked out. Please feel free to leverage that code when creating this code.

  - Render all of the wishes from the wishes table when the `'/'` get route is hit. Additionally show the form that the user can use to create a new wish. The form will POST to the `'/'` route.

  - The `'/'` post route will insert the wish from the form into the wishes table and will redirect the user back to the `'/'` get route.
